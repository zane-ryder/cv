  <body>
      <p>
      Below is a list of my favourite hobbies but for the sake of minimalism,
      I've decided to list a few things for your amusement. I feel as though coding
      is quickly becoming my most prominent hobby. I've faced a few challenges so far and
      anticipate even more harder challenges down the road. <br>
      I have accepted it as a personal challenge to continue "leveling" up! I am hopeful in converting this wondering skill into
      a fruitful career for the rest of my life</p><br>
